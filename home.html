        <h3>Poverty</h3>
        <p>Poverty is the leading cause of food Insecurity globally. A lack of access to clean water and food, good education, and working  infrastructure create breeding grounds of food insecurity as access to nourishment is almost always correlated with a good living situation

      </div>
      <h3>Affordable Housing</h3>
       <p>Lack of Affordable Housing is greatly responsible for high prevalences of food insecurity especially in urban areas. Without affordable housing, many families will have to spend inordinate amounts of money on rent and bill payments neglecting actions like grocery shopping which directly affect the availability of food in that household.

      </a> 
      </div>
      <h3>Environmental causes</h3>
       <p>While still significant, albeit on a lesser note, Environmental causes are also responsible for a great deal of food scarcity globally, especially in areas like south asia where monsoons wreak havoc on the soil and the livelihoods of small-scale farmers. The best way to counteract this would be better education about natural disasters like monsoons and how to avoid + recover from such things.
